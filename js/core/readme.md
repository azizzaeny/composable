## Core 
clojure core library but implemented in javascript.

#### Problem
I like clojure, prefer clojure, love the philosophy of it, the concept about it and the simplicity of the language, especially doing the functional programming work on clojure.  
But,  
As Software Developers there are several use cases that we cannot be picky about certain development methods, ideas, and programming paradigms that we usually used daily in our work.
lets me elaborate on that.  

- You have recently joined an established team of developers that use object-oriented style programming and cannot use functional programming style into the team to immediately adapt and work as the way you like it.  
- You are the third party developer that needs to fix code on the production of the current development team, but you cannot convert the whole code into clojure. 
- Your team is working on javascript language while you yourself has experiencing the light of doing clojure development but you cannot bring the arguments to your bosses and college to change the whole development around it
