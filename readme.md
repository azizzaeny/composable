## Composable  

Composable is a collection of reusable functions to solve programming problems through composition. It provides a toolkit for general-purpose functional programming, covering patterns, side-effect handling, and data structure algorithms.

> Composable aims to help you to "compose" or build solutions by combining smaller, modular parts.
